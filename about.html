    <h1>'bout me</h1>
    <p>oh hey there, stay a while and listen to me talk 'bout myself if you want<br><br>
    call me Mouse or Maggie (she/her)<br>
    i'm a lonely american teenager trying to cope with the isolation of the modern day because i have not many friends that feel <em>real</em>, y'know?<br>
    shut up i'm not being edgy >:(<br><br>
    i love anime and music and stories in general and i like all sort of nerdy shenanigans, from ttrpgs to programming to video games to retro web stuff (why i'm here)<br>
    i feel totally cheated that i didn't get to be alive at the apex of the 90s web so i made myself a place on the indieweb<br>
    you can email me at <a href="mailto:least_mouse@yahoo.com">least_mouse@yahoo.com</a></p>
    <h1>about the website</h1>
    <p>this is a place where i will talk about the things i like and whatever else i feel like talking about. expect anime, gaming, programming/webdev (webdev as far as this counts as webdev lol) and angsty ramblings about the modern internet (i haven't written any sort of manifesto yet but i will, just you wait).<br>
