    <h1>how i found the small web</h1>
    <h2>or old web, or indie web, or whatever you wanna call it.</h2>
    <p>to be completely fair, i'd have to start when i found computers at all, but that would take too long.<br>aaaaanyways, it all started, more or less, about 4 or 5 hours ago (i'd been exposed to the old web before that and pined for geocities, found neocities, but then did not fully comprehend how to do it and then forgot about it) when a tumblr user i follow mentioned that her girlfriend needed help with neocities or something and i was like <bold>wait.</bold> neocities? that reminds me of something but idk what it is imma go look it up because i remember it vaugel- <em>wait it was this i remeber this was so cool but i didn't do anything because small.</em><br>i waffled around on the neocities home page a fair bit, learning more about it, checking how i felt about it, etc. i clicked the browse sites button at the top, and clicked on a few websites, found sadgrl's or some other person who had a yesterweb ring on it, and found my way to a lot of cool sites and was just <bold>mind blown</bold> by the sheer intensity of everything i saw and stayed up until 5 am in the fucking morning looking at cool websites.<br>and then i spun up a neocities website because i wanted to be a part of something cooler and more personal than the yucky new web and social media and stuff.<br><br>and now i am here typing these words at 5 am because blue light is my caffeine. i think i may go to bed now or something.</p>
