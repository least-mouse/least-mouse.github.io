      <h1>I made a gemini capsule and it's super boring but the tech is pretty cool.</h1> 
      <p>gemini as a concept is super rad and i think it's a little better at the original intention of the world wide web (i.e. communicating ideas) than what the web has evolved to but it also lacks the unbridled chaos of a homemade website. the gemini capsule was mostly an experiment to see how hard it was and if it worked and how cool it was (pretty cool but like i said, it leaves a lot to default which is 100% by design and i think the design is good at what it intends to do, which is probably not to make super graphic and wacky websites, but is for simple(r), lightweight webbing.) <br></p>
      <p><a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">the gemini project</a>, the lovely <a href="https://gemini.yesterweb.org/">yestercities</a> and also here's my <a href="gemini://least-mouse.cities.yesterweb.org/"
>capsule</a> if you wanna take a peek (its not all that cool and the link may or may not work lol).</p>
