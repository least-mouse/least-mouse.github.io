      <h1>Oh yeah! I have a website!</h1>
      <p>ive been suuuper busy lately wow. up until like today i haven't had the energy or time to update my website on the weekends because i just wanted to sleep.
      <p>ive gotten really into fallout new vegas, which might be a bit...... cliche of me, considering the whole trans girl thing. it is like legit one of the best games ive ever played, even though i still haven't beaten it yet. i think i might write something about fallout nv overall, sort of a review/analysis deal, could be fun.
      <p>i also bought this super rad book that i haven't finished yet but love to death, <em>The Last Girl Scout</em>. It's written by the very cool <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/natalieironside">Natalie Ironside</a> and it's about.... well i don't wanna go spoil anything, she's got her own sort of synopsis/why you should read it <a href="https://natalieironside.tumblr.com/post/650691309562101760/you-should-read-the-last-girl-scout">here</a>.
      <p><br>on a more personal note, GREAT FUCKING NEWS!! i got one of the lead roles in my school's straight play! (straight play = not a musical, like shakespeare etc). this is literally historic at my school because im a FRESHMAN!! im so fucking excited this is gonna be really fun. AND this means i get to spend more time with my super cool senior friend who is just the epitome of everything i want to be because she's so cool. the only thing that kinda sucks is that a) the character's a guy but im boymoding for safety until i graduate so that's to be expected and b) im a 15 year old autistic boy's abusive father. the play we're doing is <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime</em>, and it should be pretty fun and a massive learning experience for me because im a freshman and have no idea what im doing. my only hope is that i dont fuck this up majorly.
      <p>i am fully convinced that i owe this role to a cockroach. i will explain. i was in the shower, washing my hair, night before auditions for the straight play, and i see this cockroach hanging out on the shower curtain. my first reaction is EW ROACH, but then i just stand there for a second and think about what to do because i dont want to touch it and i would have to move the shower curtain (which it is on) to get something to pick it up with so i just leave it. then it occurs to me that the cockroach is alive and should be respected. next i think about how roaches are super resilient and can survive a whole lot of shit. this leads me to believe that cockroaches are good luck and if you see one it's a good omen. also my belief system now incorporates cockroaches.
      <p><br>i dunno if ive mentioned that im also in marching band yet, but i guess now is better than never. anyways, weve been working at the halftime show super hard lately and its finally starting to look good. 
      <p><br>in the lapse between posts, ive shifted politics from marxism into anarcho-communism, been reading some kropotkin. well-being for all and all that. i'll probably put this into the links page too, but here's <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/special/index">an anarchist library</a> if you wanna learn more about what it is and stuff.
      <p><br>see ya laterrrr</p>
