      <h1>2022-08-07/pico-8!!p</h1>
      <p>this week was preeetty good, pretty good. i finished a job i was working on for a friend and pocketed a cool $100 and decided to spend $15 of that on <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">pico-8</a> which is a very fun little fantasy console where you make (and play) games written in a slighty non-standard version of lua. i followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NerdyTeachers">nerdyteachers</a>' tutorial for making a platformer and i gotta say i find pico-8 pretty fun to use. if you got the spare cash and or wanna try out some retro game dev give it a shot. i think my favorite feature, other than the general ease of use, is how you can export your games to these cute little "carts". (carts are your whole game, in a .png smaller than like 32kb)<br>i'm excited to see what i can make with this, i'll prolly pop up any projects i do over here (or at least a link to the pico-8 bbs) if anyone wants to see them and also so i can see myself get better.<br><br>in other news, school's starting this week, sure hope im able to make a few friends in my classes or have classes with my current friends so i'm not bored out of my mind.</p>
