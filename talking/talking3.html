      <p>god it's been a week. i feel so... tired like i want to just sleep forever or run off into the woods or something. <br>
      i don't even know what i'm supposed to be doing anymore. i still have to finish some stuff before school starts but there's just no motivation left in me.
      the older i get the more i realize that experiencing being alive is so crazy. like i'm a load of stuff that somehow became sentient and used that sentience to get into this situation somehow. <br>
      god i can't wait until school starts im getting cabin fever or something my family is driving me insane<br><br>
      stores are so stressful who made them like this. i can't possibly think of something so oppressive to human existence than a walmart.<br>
      at the same time its this weird experience of observing other people doing things just pickin up bread and looking at it. and all the people in the walmart are real living people of some amount of success. like they're adults who provide for themselves and stuff. blows my mind that i'm supposed to be like that some day lmao</p>
